## Project Overview

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple web application that allows two players to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O." The game tracks the score for both players and the number of draws. When a player wins, the game announces the winner and highlights the winning boxes. The board is then reset, and players can choose to reset the points as well. The game provides a user-friendly interface and keeps track of the score and current turn. Additionally, players can toggle between two color schemes for the game board.
