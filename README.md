## Project Overview

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple web application that allows two players to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O." The game tracks the score for both players and the number of draws. When a player wins, the game announces the winner, and the board is reset. Players can reset the board or the points at any time. The game provides a user-friendly interface and keeps track of the score and current turn.

---

## Features

- **Two players**: Player X and Player O take turns to mark the grid.
- **Score tracking**: Displays scores for Player X, Player O, and Draws.
- **Win detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or when there is a draw.
- **Game reset**: Resets the board after each game and keeps a running score.
- **Input validation**: Ensures that squares cannot be clicked multiple times during the game.
- **Buttons for resetting**: Options to reset the board, reset points, or reset everything.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application (linked as `style.css`).
